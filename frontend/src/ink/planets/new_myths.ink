You land in what seems to be a planet covered in crimson - as you look around you, all you can see is a dense forest. 
However, this forest isn't made of the trees or plants you've seen before. As your eyes adjust to the ruby haze, you notice that you are surrounded by streams of fabric. 
The fabric is beautifully woven, with shimmering embroidery that glints faintly as if glowing. 
You feel... warm. As if someone is holding you tightly, like a kiss on the cheek, like being cradled to sleep. 
As you wade through the layers of silk, you reach a clearing, where a lady sits, faintly sobbing. 
"What happened to you, my darling?", The woman whispers, as she cradles a piece of silk in her hands.
*[Ask the lady what's wrong.]->helpsilklady
*[Walk away, see what's beyond the silk.]->wandertosilk
===helpsilklady===
"Oh, hello... I'm just... well, look!" The lady shows you the silk. 
It has a large tear in the centre, and seems to have lost its colour around the tear.
"I... had an argument with my partner. And it didn't go well."
"When they left, I felt my silk tear. It's all my fault!"
"I don't know what to do..." The lady sheds a tear over the torn silk.

"I think that would be nice..." the lady sniffles. 
You sit with her, and she tells a story to you.

"I understand..." the lady sniffles.

===artistmendsilk===
"Oh, could you? I would be so eternally grateful!"
You pull out your red thread and needle. The red is a perfect match to the silk.
You get to work - the lady watches you in your mastery as you seamlessly make the silk whole again.
When you're finished, the thread glows. And the lady faintly smiles.
"It's not a complete fix, but I feel ready to fix the rest. I cannot thank you enough, friend."
She reaches into a little bag, and pulls out a small silk square with a gold star embroidered on the front. 
"Take this - follow the star, and you'll find where you need to be."
*[Thank you.] ->artistjourneyheart
===artistjourneyheart===
As you turn around to leave, the silk square in your hand glows. 
The glow engulfs you, and in a blink of an eye, you're transported.
As you look around, you notice you're in a cave, the walls made of the dense silk forestry you saw before. 
You have made it to the heart of the planet - the Fate. ->theheart
==followthesilk==
"The best adivce I can give you is to follow the silk - they all really do lead to the heart. 
"I wish you luck, friend. It was lovely to meet you."
You can spend as long as you'd like here, but when you're ready, follow the silk. 
*[I'm ready - Red Silk of Fate]->traveltotheheart
===wandertosilk===
You pass the lady, and continue further into the jungle of silk. 
A faint glow of different coloured lights start to appear in your vision. 
You head toward it, and you find what seems to be a light show, in all its brilliance and spectacle. 
The lights start to condense, and wash over one of the lines of silk, lighting up the pathway for a brief moment, and travels along the path into the distance. 
You feel called to the silk.
*[I touch the silk.]->touchthesilk
*[I follow the silk.]->followsilk2
==traveltotheheart==
You leave the light show, and make your way through the forest of silk. As you walk through, one particular silk catches your eye - it glows brighter than the others, and you can hear a soft hum, as if it calls to you. 
*[I touch the silk.]->touchthesilk
*[I follow the silk.]->followsilk2
==touchthesilk==
You touch the silk, and the warmth you have felt grows. What felt like a warm hug becomes a thick blanket of visible red glow, which covers you. 
The red glow suddenly starts to lift you off the ground, and takes you high above the red forest. As you are taken up into the sky, you look down to see the light show, and the crowd cheering along. 
Things feel small from up here. You feel calm. You gently land through the thickest part of the forest.
As you look around, you notice you're in a cave, the walls made of the dense silk forestry you saw before. 
You have made it to the heart of the planet - the Fate.->theheart
==followsilk2==
You follow the glowing silk - it takes you through a labyrinthine chase - the glow seems to move across the silk as if inviting you to a chase.
You pick up speed, pushing away wades of silk as you do. It fills you with pure joy, you almost forget that you're running. Eventually, your chase slows down as you near the thickest part of the forest.
As you look around, you notice you're in a cave, the walls made of the dense silk forestry you saw before. 
You have made it to the heart of the planet - the Fate.->theheart

"I have been waiting for you, young one."
You're taken by surprise, and the voice laughs.
"I know what you seek. You have been collecting many pieces of a past memory, and I wish to help you."
"But I will not give this away for free - The last time I let someone through, they stole my beloved star from me."
You wonder what this might mean.
*[Hang on... what is the star?]->starsilk
*[I'm sorry to hear.] ->riddleintro
===starsilk===
"If you must ask, I had made this star, preserved on the first silk brought to this planet. It heals the broken hearts of those who seek it."
"A lady came here to seek help... she knew its power, and stole it from me."
*[Do you mean this? (OPEN INVENTORY)] ->foundsilk1
*[I see.] ->riddleintro
===foundsilk1===
You present the starry silk that brought you here.
"Where... where did you find it?" The silk in your hand floats in the air.
"Thank you for returning it to me... you will be greatly rewarded!"
